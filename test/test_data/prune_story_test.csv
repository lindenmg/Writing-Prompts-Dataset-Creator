"You've Got Me All Wrong

The headline stared out at me as boring and unoriginal as ever. ""The Captivator Kills 10!"" I snorted. The Captivator probably the lamest super villain name of all time. What is even more insulting, however, is just how wrong this paper is. How is it that I get blamed for the death of ten people when it was the stupid Ruby Wolf that is to blame for all of this. I mean seriously how inept can one super hero be? Granted the Ruby Wolf isn't very good with people, but you would think she'd at least know not to crash into them and kill them.","You've Got Me All Wrong

It was gone as quick as it had appeared. I can feel my finger wrap around the trigger and give it a slight pull, but before it can finish the sounds of gunshots echo through the building. The sights and sounds are quickly replaced with an empty blackness and deafening silence.
