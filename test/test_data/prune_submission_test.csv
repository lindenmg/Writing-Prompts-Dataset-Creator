Clad in battle-worn armor, his golden locks peeking out from beneath a gleaming helmet, Sir Palquin of Tristran bellowed out his challenge. He had followed the clues given to him by the king's scouts and tracked the elusive drake to its hideout.

He rode his faithful steed Biscuit to the mouth of the cave and had braved the rest of the journey on foot. Now he stood, gleaming sword brandished and awaiting the dragon that had kidnapped the Princess. And if the heavy footfalls were anything to go by, it was lumbering towards him.
